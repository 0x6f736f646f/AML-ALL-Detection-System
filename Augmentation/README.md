# Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classifier Data Augmentation
![Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic (AML/ALL) Leukemia Python Classifiers](Media/Images/banner.png) 

The AML Classifier Data Augmentation program applies filters to datasets and increases the amount of training / test data available to use. The program is part of the computer vision research and development for the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic (AML/ALL) Leukemia AI Research Project.

# Datasets
The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects. You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.
