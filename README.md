![Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System](Media/Images/banner.png)

The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System is an open source classifier including data management, training and running Convolutional Neural Networks on the edge with Intel technologies and a locally hosted PHP/MySQL webe/API server.

This project is made up of the below components which work together to provide a locally hosted management system that lets you upload and classifiy test data and see the results visually. Follow the completed tutorials above in the same order. A full system setup requires [Server](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Detection-System/tree/master/Server/V1 "Server"), [Facial-Auth](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Detection-System/tree/master/Facial-Auth/V1 "Facial-Auth"), [Data Augmentation](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Detection-System/tree/master/Augmentation/V1 "Data Augmentation"), [NCS1 Tensorflow Classifier](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Detection-System/tree/master/Classifiers/Movidius/NCS/Tensorflow/V1 "NCS1 Tensorflow Classifier"), [Chatbot](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Detection-System/tree/master/Chatbot "Chatbot") and tutorials to be completed.
