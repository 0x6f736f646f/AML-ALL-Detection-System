# Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System
![Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System](Media/Images/banner.png)
The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System is an open source classifier including data management, training and running Convolutional Neural Networs on the edge with Intel technologies and a locally hosted PHP/MySQL webe/API server.|

This project is made up of the below components which work together to provide a locally hosted management system that lets you upload and classifiy test data and see the results visually. Follow the completed tutorials above in the same order.  A full system setup requires [Server](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Server "Server"), [Data Augmentation](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Augmentation "Data Augmentation"), [NCS1 Classifier](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Classifiers/Movidius/NCS/ "NCS1 Classifier"), [Chatbot](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Chatbot "Chatbot") and [Vision](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Vision "Vision") tutorials to be completed. You will be able to find each of the components used below in our other project repositories which will allow you to run them as standalone devices, in the future this repository will be checked to ensure they can be run both independently as well as running as part of the GeniSys network.

| Project  | Description | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- | 
| [Server](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Server "Server") | A local PHP/MySQL server hosting a web based UI for managing and classifying data. Uses facial recognition for authentication. | Development | 
| [Augmentation](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Augmentation "Data Augmentation") | Applies filters to the original dataset and increases the amount of training / test data. | COMPLETE |
| [NCS1](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Classifiers/Movidius/NCS/ "NCS1 Classifier") | Hosts a REST API with access to the AML/ALL NCS1 Classifier using NCS & NCSDK. | COMPLETE |   
| [NCS2](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Classifiers/Movidius/NCS2/ "NCS2 Classifier") | Hosts a REST API with access to the AML/ALL NCS2 Classifier using NCS2 & OpenVino. | Development |
| [Chatbot](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Chatbot "Chatbot") | Hosts a REST API with access to the Natural Language Understanding Engine trained with basic knowledge of AML. | COMPLETE |
| [Vision](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Vision "Vision") | Hosts a REST API with access to the Siamese Neural Networks classifier. | COMPLETE | 
| [Android](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Android "Android") | An Android application for speaking to the AML/ALL Naturall Language Understanding Engine. | Development |
