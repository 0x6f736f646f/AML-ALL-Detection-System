An open source Acute Myeloid Leukemia Detection System including data management, training and running facial and image classifiers on the edge with Intel technologies.

| Project  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| [Android](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Android "Android") | An Android application for managing and classifying data. Uses facial recognition for authentication. |  
| [Chatbot](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Chatbot "Chatbot") | A REST API hosting an endpoint for Natural Language Understanding. Trained on knowledge of AML. | 
| [Classifier](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Server "Classifier") | A REST API hosting an endpoint for classifying images using Convolutional Neural Networks. |  
| [Security](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Security "Security") | A REST API hosting an endpoint for authentication using Siamese Neural Networks | 
| [Server](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Server "Server") | A local server hosting a web based UI for managing and classifying data. Uses facial recognition for authentication. |
