# Operating System

- Tested on [Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (Xenial Xerus))](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ "Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (Xenial Xerus)") and [Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ "Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"), previous versions have been tested in Windows successfully but you need to make sure you install MITIE correctly on your Windows machine.

&nbsp;

# Python Versions

- Tested with Python 3.5

&nbsp;

# Software Requirements

- [Tensorflow 1.4.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install "Tensorflow 1.4.0") (May work with other versions)
- [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/ "TFLearn")
- [MITIE](https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE "MITIE")
- [NTLK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/ "NTLK (Natural Language Toolkit)")

&nbsp;

# Hardware Requirements

- 1 x Desktop device or laptop for development and training, preferably with an NVIDIA GPU

&nbsp;

# Installation & Setup

The following guides will give you the basics of setting up a GeniSys NLU Engine.

## Clone The Acute Myeloid Leukemia Detection System Repo

First you need to clone the Acute Myeloid Leukemia Detection System repo to the machine you will be running it on. To do so, navigate to the directory you want to place it in terminal and execute the following command:

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System.git
```

Once you have done this, you have all the code you need on your machine.

## Install The Required Software

Now you need to install the required software, I have provided a requirements file that will contain all required modules for the project. You can use it to install the modules using the following command:

```
 $ sh setup.sh
```

The command execute the setup shell file which will istall the required software for the project including **NTLK**, **TFLearn**, **MITIE**. If for any reason the pip3 installs fail, you will have to install them manually:

```
 $ pip3 install ..... --user
```

&nbsp;

# Training Data

Now it is time to think about training data. In the [Model/Data/training.json](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Chatbot/Model/Data/training.json "Model/Data/training.json") file I have provided some starter data, it is not a lot but enough to have a good test and show the example further on in the tutorial.

&nbsp;

# Extensions

Extensions are external Python classes that you can use to extend the functionality used to generate a response. Extensions should be stored in the [extensions](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/tree/master/Chatbot/extensions "extensions") directory.

&nbsp;

# Training Your NLU Engine

[![Training Your NLU Engine](Media/Images/TrainingShot.png)](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Chatbot/Train.py)

Now everything is set up, it is time to train. The main functionality for the training process can be found in [Train.py](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Train.py "Train.py"), [Classes/Data.py](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Classes/Data.py "Classes/Data.py"), [Classes/Model.py](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Classes/Model.py "Classes/Model.py") and [Classes/Mitie.py](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Classes/Mitie.py "Classes/Mitie.py"), the configuration for training can be found and modified in [Required/confs.json](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Required/confs.json "Required/confs.json"). If you have modified your training data, you may need to update your configuration from time to time.

To begin training, make sure you are all set up, navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

```
 $ python3 Run.py TRAIN
```

&nbsp;

# Communicating with your AI Locally

Now you have trained your AI, it is time to test her out! In this tutorial I will base my explanation on the conversation block at the beginning of this tutorial. As your AI is now trained, all you need to do (assuming you are in the project root), is execute the following code:

```
 $ python3 run.py INPUT
```

If you have looked through the example dataset, you may notice that **I was wondering if AML affects people that older more than younger people, or the other way round?** is not in the training data, the actual training data provided to the AI related to this question is actually:

```
"intent": "AMLAge",
"text": [
    "Who does AML affect?",
    "Who does Acute Myeloid Leukemia affect?",
    "What age group does AML affect?",
    "What age group does Acute Myeloid Leukemia affect?",
    "How old do you have to be to get AML?",
    "How old do you have to be to get Acute Myeloid Leukemia?",
    "Does Acute Myeloid Leukemia affect older or younger people?"
]
```

You can see that although **I was wondering if AML affects people that older more than younger people, or the other way round?** is not in the training data, the AI was still able to classify and respond correctly.

&nbsp;

# Inference Via The HTTP Requests

You can run the Run program in server mode to fire up an API endpoint that allows you to do inference via HTTP calls. To start your NLU engine in server mode, you can enter the following commands into terminal:

```
 $ python3 run.py SERVER
```

You will now be able to access your NLU by posting to http://YourDomain:YourPort/infer, to do this, I provided an an API client programmed in Python which takes your input from console and sends it to the server for processing: [Acute Myeloid Leukemia Detection System Chatbot Client](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Detection-System/blob/master/Chatbot/Client.py "Acute Myeloid Leukemia Detection System Chatbot Client").

Navigate to the project root and execute the following command to send a query to your NLU engine, you can use any question or statement, but bear in mind it must be within the boundaries of variations of the training date.

```
 $ python3 Client.py CLASSIFY "Can you tell me what age groups Acute Myeloid Leukemia would mainly affect?"
```
